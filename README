Math-Polynomial-Cyclotomic
==========================

Math::Polynomial::Cyclotomic is an extension of Math::Polynomial
generating cyclotomic polynomials and factoring rational polynomials of
the form x^n-1.  Cyclotomic polynomials are monic irreducible polynomials
with integer coefficients that are a divisor of some binomial x^n-1 but
not of any other binomial x^k-1 with k < n.
